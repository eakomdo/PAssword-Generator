# This code generates a random password based on user input for length and character types.
# It ensures the password meets minimum length requirements and allows the user to choose whether to include special
# characters. The password is generated using a combination of letters, digits, and punctuation based on the user's preferences.
# The code also includes error handling for invalid inputs and provides feedback to the user on the password
## generation process.
# The password is printed to the console after generation.
# The code is designed to be user-friendly and provides clear instructions for input.
# The password generation process is randomized to ensure unique passwords each time.
# The code is structured to be easily maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.
# The password is generated using Python's built-in libraries for randomness and string manipulation.
# The code is efficient and performs well for generating passwords of reasonable lengths.
# The password generation process is secure and follows best practices for creating strong passwords.
# The code is well-documented with comments explaining each step of the process.
# The password generator can be easily integrated into larger applications or used as a standalone script.
